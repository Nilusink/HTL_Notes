An operating system (OS) is a software that manages and controls the hardware and software resources of a computer. It acts as a bridge between the computer user and the computer hardware, allowing users to interact with the computer's functions and applications in a user-friendly way. In simple terms, an OS is like the brain of a computer, coordinating and managing all its operations to ensure smooth functioning.
